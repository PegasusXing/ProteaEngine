ProteaEngine is an early-stage rendering engine for Windows, built as a learning tool for game engine development.
Currently not much is implemented, however this entire project serves as a hands-on educational experience to understand
the fundamentals of engine architecture, graphics programming, and system design.

This project draws inspiration from TheCherno's engine development series found at thecherno.com/engine, adapted and
expanded upon as part of my personal development journey in understanding how modern game engines work from the ground
up.
